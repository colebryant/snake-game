nand2tetris Project 9
Part of a series of projects building a computer from first principles.

* NOTE: Utilized existing Jack Random Number generator class from a GitHub account in order to randomize the location of the food in the game, as the Jack library does not have a random number generator. Source: https://github.com/xctom/Nand2Tetris/blob/master/projects/09/PigDice/Random.jack. This file is called Random.jack in my implementation.

* To Play:

	1) Open the Snake/ directory in Hack VMEmulator (from nand2tetris.org)

	2) In the Hack VMEmulator, set the speed to fast and remove the program/ data flow animation.

	3) Press Run.

	4) Press 'S' to start and begin by using the arrow keys to navigate the snake around the screen.

	5) The goal of the game is to eat as much of the food as possible and increase the score (shown on the bottom right corner). If the snake hits the borders of the screen or its own body, it's game over. Press 'R' to restart the game.
